<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>I have loved spidey ever since I was a kid, always watching the 90's Spider-Man Animated Series. I have always wanted to write my own Spider-Man story line. My brother and I discuss ideas for different spideys for fun. I drew this after we brainstormed a new Spider-Man for a couple of weeks. However, this painting is more inspired by the standard Earth-616 Spider-Man.</p>

<p>I DO NOT OWN Spider-Man. This piece was made simply for fun, practice, and education. I do not, will not and refuse to make money off of this piece. My site does not bring in revinue either. Spider-Man is owned by whoever owns him... who knows these days. Insomniac Games are the Spider-Kings regardless!</p>
