<h2><center>Path of Pain</center></h2>


<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>I'm not a sneaker-head, but have always been a fan of the Nike SB sneakers. I used to own a purple/black pair and miss them dearly. One day I got the impulse to design a pair of my own in photoshop. I used Pain from Naurto : Shippuden as inspiration.</p>
