> The following is a card game I created for my game design class in college. I believe the directions may have some remaining ambiguity, as well as some html to clean up. I also need to replace the artwork with my own at some point. This project is low priority in the present scope of internship application. I simply wanted to post it here for the sake of showing my history with card games, love of card games, and desire to create more!
