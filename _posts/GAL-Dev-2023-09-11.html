<p>This is the first official dev log post for Project GAL.</p>

<h2>Background and Intentions</h2>
<p>Project GAL aims to fill the gap in my portfolio with a 3D game development project, enhancing my prospects in the video game industry job market.</p>

<h2>Development Approach</h2>
<p>Originally, the project was a Western-themed bullet hell game. To ensure timely completion, I simplified it into a rail-based Western gallery shooter inspired by Disneyland's <i>Toy Story Midway Mania</i> and the arcade classic <i>Time Crisis</i>. With the prefabs and systems I'm implementing, I intend to modify it into the original 3rd person POV concept later on.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Issues</h2>
<p>The initial dolly-track navigation presented camera challenges due to sudden directional changes. I redesigned the path as a straight-track with player-controlled first-person aiming. Players can look around within set limits, improving immersion. A centered reticle follows mouse-controlled camera motion.</p>
<p>The player character was initially planned for 3rd-person POV but was changed to 1st-person POV due to the complexity of 3D character rigging/animating.</p>
<p>Hardware limitations on my aging PC have affected efficiency. Understanding control flow between Unity's Editor and Play modes and standalone exe has been a learning curve. I'm exploring different coding patterns, currently using Tarodev's singleton systems and considering a return to a C# native State Machine and custom event system, which I've used in previous projects for better code decoupling.</p>
