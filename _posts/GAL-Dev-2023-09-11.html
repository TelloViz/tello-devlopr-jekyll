<p>This is the first official dev log post for Project GAL.</p>

<h2>Background and Intentions</h2>
<p>Project GAL aims to fill my portfolio's gap in 3D game development. My goal is to enhance my prospects in the video
  game industry job market.</p>

<h2>Development Approach</h2>
<p>Originally, the project was a Western-themed bullet hell game, but to ensure a timely completion, I simplified it
  into a
  rail-based Western gallery shooter inspired by Disneyland's <i>Toy Story Midway Mania</i> and the arcade classic
  <i>Time Crisis</i>. With the prefabs and systems I am implementing with this new version, I intend to modify it into
  the original 3rd person POV concept later on.
</p>

<h2>Challenges and Issues</h2>
<p>Initially, a winding dolly-track navigated a Western settlement. However, this caused camera challenges when the
  dolly-cart's sudden directional changes instantaneously altered the forward vector
  of the player/camera. To simplify, I redesigned the travel path as a straight-track with player-controlled
  first-person aiming from the cart. Players can look around within clamped limits, enhancing immersion. A centered
  reticle follows the player's mouse-controlled camera motion.</p>
<p>The player character was originally intended to be controlled from a 3rd-person POV, but after considering the
  complexity of 3D character rigging/animating, I opted to take a 1st person POV approach instead.</p>
<p>Hardware limitations on my aging PC have hampered efficiency. Within Unity, understanding control flow between Editor
  and Play modes and standalone exe has been a learning curve. I'm exploring different coding patterns, currently using
  Tarodev's singleton systems and considering a return to a C# native State Machine and custom event system, that I've
  used in previous projects, for greater
  code decoupling.</p>
